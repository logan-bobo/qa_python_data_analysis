# qa_python_data_analysis
Data analysis task assigned to me as part of a software engineering program I am on.


Code snippet for Python data:

```
data=[90,30,13,67,85,87,50,45,51,72,64,69,59,17,22,23,44,25,16,67,85,87,50,45,51,72,59,14,50,55,32,23,24,25,37,28,39,30,33,35,40,34,41,43,94,95,98,99,44,45,47,48,49,53,61,63,69,75,77,60,83]
```

There are three parts to this task:

 - Part 1 - Using a list, you will be required to calculate and print to the console the following information:
The number of students' marks in the data sample
The lowest and highest marks
The average mark, formatted to two decimal places
 - Part 2 - you will be required to write code to process the data and calculate how many instances of marks in the 
categories shown below. Alongside each category you should print out one asterisk for each occurrence. As an example, 
the category 10-20 has four occurrences (13, 17, 16 & 14) and therefore has four asterisks
 - Part 3 - Finally, you will be requested to calculate and print out what the pass mark should be to ensure that at least 
60% of students will pass the exam. This should be to the nearest ten
